  <p> We want to fight factory farms because of their unethical treatment of animals, their exploitative nature with valuable resources, and their negative effects on the environment. In general, meat from animals contain high or unhealthy levels of e Coli, cholesterol, and saturated fat. We believe that meat alternatives are a better option because they eliminate or reduce the problems aforementioned, their products contain the same nutrients as meat, and their products taste just like meat. </p>
